As I get older I've calmed down quite a bit. Things that really annoyed me 10 years ago mostly don't. However, I've run into one thing that I doubt 
I'll ever outgrow, twice, recently. I've spent some time reflecting on it. 

# A little learning is a dangerous thing

I started going back through my old <a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-Course-Probability-8th/dp/013603313X/">A First Course in Probability textbook</a>. 
It was the only class I've ever had to retake. I got a D, then mercifully a C. Going back through I still can't follow some 
of the formula manipulations. It's obvious there's a lot of good stuff in there, it's just not accessible. That's frustrating now. At the time it was 
infuriating. Yesterday, the top half of this page took me 20 minutes to work through.

    <figcaption>Maybe the 2 lines from the <span style="color:green">green box</span> to the <span style="color:blue">blue box</span> were perfectly 
	clear to someone out there. I don't think I've met them yet. It took me all the <span style="color:red">red boxed area</span> to verify this is true. 
	I would have used more space if it was available. </figcaption>
</figure>

My math is better now. As is my patience. In school I couldn't understand the steps and intuition behind how equations were arrived at. **I couldn't get 
over how unbelievably poor a book it was for its stated purpose: <u>a First Course</u>.** So I was left with rote 
memorization. Clearly, it did not go well. 


I'm also taking a cryptography course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto">Coursera</a>. I'm in the final week and really like it. It's a 
bit of a whirlwind of topics, but the material is very interesting and the professor is clearly passionate. I've been following along taking the mandatory 
quizzes. I've passed them all, but frequently find myself mad on taking them. **Inevitably I think "What the hell is this?** I have no idea how to approach this. 
**Did I miss a lecture?**". 

A typical quiz is:
+ 30% - clear application of what we learned.
+ 40% - slightly confusing, requiring review of lectures, my notes, and some thought.
+ 30% - complete left field. (I don't want to think about the time I spent on these) 

That final 30% took concepts we'd scratched the surface of and expanded out from. 
When I'd look at the lectures the details were sparse. The professor said once: "I don't want to get into the details, but for our purposes 
just know \<fill in the blank>". And now problems related to it are showing up ... Yeah, you didn't want to deal with it and neither do I....

**So, why was I mad?** Clearly it's not a productive emotion for learning...but...

## I felt a social contract had been violated
In my mind that contract read: 
<blockquote style="margin-left:10%">
"You teach, highlighting important points and structuring things. I take notes. I review sections until they make sense. 
Occassionally I hop over to some external resource to get some further detail or specifics. 
<p/>
Assignments, HW, Tests act as a check on whether I've put forward a fair effort and absorbed the material we covered. Having learned 
what we're doing I should feel comfortable working on them."
</blockquote>


The nightmare is encountering this:

# My life suddenly feels out of my control. 

Dramatic much? I know, but bear with me. The degree of distress depends on the level of investment. 

Imagine a crucial, major related, course offered once a year. That's devestating. It can threaten your planned course scheduling (the next quarter's classes 
have this one as a pre-requisite), potentially meaning another year in school, $20-$30k in costs, a resume showing a 4 year degree taking 5, etc. 

It feels like your future is on the line. I might as well be on a sub launching nukes, red lights are bouncing off metalic structures and alarms blaring.

	The feeling is basically indistinguishable right now.</figcaption>

Clearly the Coursera course is lower stakes. My investment is just the time I've put in on the previous tests. But it still comes down to...

# A sense of disconnect between effort and outcome
My investment in learning may have no ultimate bearing on my success. I could have reviewed everything, but if I 
can't discover this new relationship between X and Y that wasn't really touched on by the professor I'm screwed. 

It's certainly reasonable to argue tough, novel problems are a differentiatior. Who should get an A, B, or C? I can buy that. The 
issue comes when we cross a threshold. I know I'm not failing the class if I can walk away knowing that I got 90% right. 
That's a healthy threshold. 80%? Not terrible. 70%... I now have no margin for any silly errors.

**As the uncertainty mounts my grade (future) becomes more dependent on the professor's discretion.** There's a lot suddenly riding on the kindness of 
a stranger I met a few months ago to give me a fair shake with partial credit, curving, etc.

My younger sister mentioned that the class average on her Thermodynamics midterm was a 43%... I believe her. In quite a 
few classes I encountered the same thing. 

It's unnerving. **Moreover it seems like you're being given something, rather than earning it.** I didn't feel like I'd learned the topics in those classes. 
I felt like the teacher and I had mutually failed. Now to avoid the embarassment of dozens of students dropping out or falling behind we'd been given 
a reprieve. My level of confidence in that material was very low. I wasn't looking over at my buddy and saying: "Let's go out into the world and build bridges.
Between the 2 of us we got an 86%, so what can't we do!?!"

You could certainly argue that humility is valuable in education. There's always more to learn. There's a danger in ignorantly believing you know all there is 
to know, but clearly this is pretty extreme. 

**I don't believe the source of the disconnect is malicious**, rather...

# Students are from Saturn, Professors from Pluto

We have 2 very different populations interacting in a course: graduate students (and former grad students) who are acting as 
professors, TAs, etc. and the students (largely undergrads, who will not go on to postgrad studies). Those groups **have different success models.** 

As someone entering into this field, if I can apply and understand the basic principles in the real world, that's a fantastic outcome. I'll shake your hand 
and thank you for a great course.

I suspect for the professor and TAs basic application is boring and unrewarding. Their career success relies on branching out into new directions with their 
research. An understanding of the work of others and the state of the art is just a necessary step along the way. I don't think that foundational knowledge
is rewarded, but instead considered pro forma. Further, this is all old stuff for them. It seems slow and trudging.

# My prescription (TLDR)

The most human thing in the world is to extrapolate based on our own experiences. If I'm finding this dull isn't it natural the students would as well? 
Let's move onto a novel problem! How could these students not be bored with these basics? Why not provide further opportunity for expansion 
and discovery? Give them a taste of those magical "Aha!" moments that can lead to publishing, grants, etc.

It's a noble goal, but needs to be tempered by 2 things:
1. There's a fixed amount of time and effort I can invest in your class. I've got other classes, life, work, etc. I'm looking for 
  a mastery of basics, a curated experience of the subject. <br/><br/>
  Sound priviledged? Perhaps. But that's entire value proposition for higher education. An interested student 
  could certainly buy the books and read the research articles themselves. But the hope is to get a guide through foreign territory. 

2. As we get further from what was actually taught there's the danger exemplified in this cartoon.
