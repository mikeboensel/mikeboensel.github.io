Hi, I'm Mike. I'm a perpetual dabbler. It's a problem. 

When labeled as "dabbling" that's obvious, but imagine if I said: "I'm Mike, and 
I'm always trying to learn". That doesn't sound so bad. Become a Renaissance man! Do it all! That's an admirable trait, right? 
I've learned a fair amount about making video games, building construction, wood working, AI principles, boxing, BJJ, comedy, and the list goes on. 
I'm not professing to be an expert in any of these fields, but I can hold a conversation or engage in them. 

# So... Modern Day Master or Meanderer?

The crucial separator is whether you push through to create real accomplishments. Mastery isn't 
required. You don't have to push the field forward, but would someone off the street be 
impressed? Would someone in the field give an approving nod? Is there some return (not necessarily 
financial) on this time investment? Or are you perpetually moving on to the next exciting new 
subject, or as Churchill might put it, the next intoxicating mistress? 

There's something to be said for sampling, but after a while you have to order 
a main course. I have yet to do so. You may be similar. I've thought about 
this issue and narrowed the problem down to a few concepts:

## Knowing is a lot less work than doing

    <figcaption>There's a massive chasm between knowing roughly how things work and making them work. 
</figcaption>
</figure>

<br>

Understanding the principles and doing some exercises requires time and effort. Its substantially more 
than a lot of people do, but its dramatically less than being proficient.

### I can hum along...

    <!--<figcaption></figcaption>-->
</figure>

What good is it to know the chords, notes, riffs, even some music theory on a guitar, but not be able to play any songs? 
I've certainly bettered myself, but I've failed to get to a reasonable level of proficiency. I'm perpetually a beginner in certain skills 
(strumming + keeping the beat for instance). When people ask if I play guitar I say as much. "I'm working on moving from being bad to being mediocre". 



This seems humble, but I've realized its fairly sinister. __There's a comfort in saying you're a beginner. 
It lowers people's expectations.__ They're more likely to compliment you. My failings have an excuse! The word beginner implies 
I haven't been doing this long. Thank God, the problem isn't me, its time! The truth is I've had this guitar for 8 years. 
At some point you have to assess your timeline. The point I've gotten to isn't completely useless, but ultimately 
the question is what can you do with these skills? What's my arrival date? Am I going to get this going before I head to a nursing home?

Breadth of knowledge is great and something we should all strive for, but you need appreciable depth. That's a vague term, what does 
it mean and how do I figure out what it is? Well that's easy, other people will tell you by their level of interest in what you're doing. 

Which is why...

## Others must consume your work	

<figure>

</figure>
You must create things for others to consume. This necessarily involves producing a lot of crap. That doesn't excuse poor work. 

There's an interesting disconnect in our expectations. When other people do something for us we have very high expectations. When we 
do it for ourselves standards start to slip. The key to growth is to leverage others' expectations of us.

How good does something have to be if its just for you? Not very. You may not even complete it. "I've got the gist 
of this painting thing. Brushstrokes and paint mixing until you get to a beautiful meadow. Ok. Let's move on." That's a bad 
outcome. The canvas will sit in an unfinished state, taunting you. A much better scenario would be if your niece Sarah's birthday
 was in a week. She loves meadows with horses. You've got a week. You need to be finished by Friday.

__What really matters is the final 20% that makes something as publicly presentable as you can.__ Its the areas where you 
struggle that have the value in terms of growth and learning. Unless you're exceptionally strong willed, you won't 
push yourself into those areas unless you know you have to. I certainly don't.

## Let's breakdown this post

The concept has been rattling around in my head for a while. Longer than I'd care to admit. 
A rough breakdown of my actual time writing is:

<table class="gridtable">

<tr>
 <th scope="col">Task</th>
 <th scope="col">Minutes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Outline</td>
 <td>15</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Fleshing things out</td>
 <td>30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Editing and reworking after realizing things were not cohesive</td>
 <td>30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Styling/Images</td>
 <td>30</td>
</tr>
</table>

For better or worse I've got some real time invested in this. At several points I could have posted this, 
but until the final reread I didn't find it worthwhile. It didn't represent the 
best I could do, so any feedback I got would be less useful. I wouldn't have read it if it wasn't 
my own writing until I hit that point. As near as I can tell it is now presentable, but it may be 
shit. __I'm tempted to just pocket it "for later".__

I still have a number of lingering concerns:
* Is it interesting enough (should I add pictures or some story with emotional elements)?
* Do other people have this issue or is it just me?
* Is this too rambling and long to be read? 

Trying to answer these myself would really just be procrastination at this point. They'll be answered when people 
react (or ignore) this. Putting it on the back burner would
mean it becomes just be another item I've put a lot of time into without producing a result.
You pile up enough of those they slowly eat at you. "I can't even finish a blog post, how can I get anything more 
meaningful done."

Best of luck and put shit out there!

## TL;DR

You have to jettison your work (whatever it might be) out into the world, to be judged.
