Abstraction is king. It's the reason there are stories like Instagram where 3 guys built an app used by millions
in a few weeks. There's too much complexity, too much repetition, too much tedium to think about everything that
the computer is doing. Nothing would ever get done. We want to spend the majority of our time working in our <b>problem's
    domain</b>.

<h1>Problem domain</h1>
This is the functionality you are trying to create, what at the end of the day you show people.
<br>

<p>

    <br>
    For example, you're recreating Tetris.
    <br>
    You're interested in thinking about the game. The design of the game is what you want to be
    working on.
<ul>
    <li>How do the pieces move?</li>
    <li>What shapes are there?</li>
    <li>What sounds/animation should play?</li>
    <li>Should there be a secret bonus level?</li>
    <li>How many points does clearing a line give you?</li>
</ul>

</p>

<br><br><br>


Everything outside of these core issues should fade into the background. In your ideal world you just issue a command to
the computer like:
<blockquote><code>Create a green block at the top middle of the screen</code></blockquote>
<br>
This simple operation will result in thousands of actions the computer must take. Just spitballing at a high level:
<ol>
    <li>Find the Tetris windows location on the screen</li>
    <li>Figure out what pixels correspond to the top middle of the window</li>
    <li>Create a block and keep track of it in memory</li>
    <li>Is the Tetris window covered by another programs window? If so we only display part (or none) of the block</li>
    <li>Make changes to the screen's video buffer to show the block</li>
    <li>Send the buffer on to the screen</li>
</ol>
Each of these items would break down into hundreds of smaller operations. You're making a game and interested in the
block,
not all this clutter. This is all mental overhead that results from using a computer. We want it to just happen. We
don't
want to reinvent the wheel, your Tetris game's progress would grind to a halt.
You'd spend all your time creating a way to display things on the screen and make a lot of mistakes in the process.
<br>
A 5PM conversation with the boss would look like this:
<br>
<pre>
Boss: So what do we have so far?
You: Well things are coming along... a bit slowly. But we're getting there.
B: Great, how about a quick peek?
Y: Uh, sure.
B: So why's it flickering and jumping around? I thought we were making Tetris?
Y: Oh, we are. I'm just working out a few bugs. It's really coming together. Three days ago we didn't even have flickering.
B: Well tomorrow's another day. For some of us.
</pre>
<br>
Reducing this burden of knowledge and effort is what we refer to when we talk about abstraction. Someone else has
already
spent time developing a way of displaying things on the screen. Let's use that and let it handle all the messy details.
Common names you'll hear for abstractions are libraries (APIs), runtimes, platforms, or modules. For example: The
Android Platform.
The Windows API. The C# Runtime. The Java Runtime Environment. The DirectX Library. These are all solving different
problems for us.
Great, right?

<h1>Your abstraction is leaking...</h1>
The problem is all abstractions leak. Leaking means details that are specific to the problem domain of the abstraction
(the graphical display problem domain, not our Tetris domain) end up littered all over our Tetris project.
<br>
Its important to note, the abstractions aren't leaking because the creators are bad, lazy, dumb, etc. Although they do
sometimes
make mistakes abstractions are general purpose tool we are using to solve our application's specific problem. This will
almost
always require some level of customization to fit your use case. That's just the nature of using a general purpose tools
(as opposed to something you wrote specifically for your game, as many game engines were initially written to create a
specific game, then generalized for other people's use later (Doom, Unreal, Quake, etc))

<br>
Enough theory! Lets look at what our nice clean desired command <code>Create a green block at the top middle of the
    screen</code>
might look like:
<br>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Canvas canvas = new Canvas(400, 800);
canvas.display();
Rectangle r = canvas.createRectangle(25, 25);
r.x = 200;
r.y =  100;
r.fill(#00FF00);
canvas.update();
</pre>
</blockquote>
<br>

<h2>How did we arrive here....this is terrible</h2>
I realize this is early in our journeys and may be overwhelming. I'll explain everything, don't
worry. What's great about the code above is it displays multiple layers of abstraction, all leaking.
<br>
Let's break it down in English. First we will discuss what it does. Next we will talk about why code is such terrible
semi-English.
<ol>
    <li><code>Canvas canvas = new Canvas(400, 800);</code>

        <p>We create a new Canvas. The graphics abstraction we are using requires us to first create an area we can
            "paint"
            that will be displayed on the screen. This is reasonable, although we might just want to paint our entire
            window,
            in which case this is an annoying additional step. The canvas will be 400 pixels wide X 800 pixels tall.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><code>canvas.display();</code>

        <p>We have to tell the abstraction to write to the screen the first time. It now displays an empty window pane.
            Again, this is not something we want. "My game is awesome! Look at this empty starting screen!"
            So its more steps that don't deal with creating awesome Tetris, but instead with managing the graphics
            abstraction.</p>
    </li>
    <li><code>Rectangle r = canvas.createRectangle(25, 25);</code>

        <p>We create a rectangle that is 25 pixels X 25 pixels. We give it a unique name of r. We can use this name to
            tell it to do things.</p>
    </li>
    <li><code>r.x = 200;</code>

        <p>If we don't specify where the block should go the abstraction puts it in the bottom left corner.
            That's not what we want. So lets center it (by dividing our 400 pixel width by 2)</p>
    </li>
    <li><code>r.y = 100;</code>

        <p>We want our block at the top of the Tetris screen (blocks start at the top and fall down). Here we run into a
            big obstacle. Many graphical abstraction have a coordinate system that has height counting down from the
            top. This
            is very different than the XY origin we learn in school and a pain to think in terms of. More unnecessary
            complexity for our poor Tetris game
            <figure style="float: left">
                <img src="Tetris%20-%20Axis%20Normal.jpg" alt="" height="300" width="auto">
                <figcaption>Coordinate axis as God intended them</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="Tetris%20-%20Axis%20Abomination.jpg" alt="" height="317" width="auto">
                <figcaption>The abomination every graphics library uses</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </p>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><code>r.fill(#00FF00);</code>

        <p>The block is not green by default. We have to set it as such. The #00FF00 is expressing color in hexadecimal.
            (TODO link)
            2 digits represent Red, Green, and Blue. By mixing these many colors can be created. We have 0 Red and Blue.
            We have as
            much green as possible ("FF")</p>
    </li>
    <li><code>canvas.update();</code>

        <p>
            Draw calls (instructions that write to the screen) are expensive. They take a lot of time and work. So until
            we make this call nothing changes on the screen. Another annoyance. As Tetris designers we don't want to
            manage
            this. We just want to keep track of our pieces and run the game. Displaying wasn't supposed to be handled by
            us...
            However, the graphical abstraction doesn't know anything about our Tetris game and these operations are
            expensive, so
            it relies on us to say when drawing to the screen is appropriate.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<br>

<h2>Abstraction bonus round!</h2>

<p>You're in luck. The graphical abstraction wasn't the only one we were working with! Additionally, if you've never
    programmed
    before everything above would look bizarre. Programming languages are an abstraction over the basic
    functions
    that the computer offers us. They're a few steps up and a dramatic improvement from the raw binary you see all the
    movie
    hackers looking at.
</p>

<figure>
    <img src="LeetHackerBinary.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>I'm a binary speed reader. I can read 4 lines an hour. (No one views code like this)</figcaption>
</figure>

<br><br>
Some sample code:
<blockquote>
<pre>
    int i = 1+2;
</pre>
</blockquote>

Above are performing addition and putting the resulting 3 into a variable (a box that can hold number values) called i.
Below we have the assembly for that statement. Assembly is a direct representation of binary.
In the future we will learn about assembly, but for now just observe how much less friendly and readable it is:
<blockquote>
<pre>
    TODO return to and generate real assembly
    push 1;
    push 2;
    add;
    mov [ESP-4], rax;
</pre>
</blockquote>

This is a very simple example. As code gets more complex the assembly gets MUCH nastier. The purpose of a programming
language is to make
instructing a computer easier. However, languages require rigid syntax, not the standard English statements we would
like to use. Why?
Primarily because interpreting English is hard. The language is ambiguous. Small changes can have dramatically different
meanings.

<blockquote>

<br>
I ran over to John's.
<br>
I ran over John.
<br>
3 letters an apostrophe are the different between a pleasant jog and vehicular homicide. Society exists on a razor's
edge...
</blockquote>

    <br>
Computers are becoming smarter, but still struggle. Additionally, even if they understood us perfectly, its still
possible for us
to be ambiguous or incomplete in our instructions. We frequently are and can get away with it because other human have
intuition about what we mean.
<br>

<h3>Computers are DUMB</h3>
People who don't work with computers have a perception that computers are extremely intelligent. They aren't. They do
ANYTHING
you tell them to. They just do it very quickly.

<br>
When thinking about programming its best to think of it as a series of instructions you are giving to an
extremely literal (perhaps passive aggressive?) human. These instructions will be followed to the letter.

<br>
Imagine training a new bouncer at an exclusive LA night club.
<figure>
    <img src="NightClub.jpg" alt="" height="300" width="auto">
</figure>
You set him up with a stool outside the door. "Take this clipboard.
We open at 9PM. Someone comes up to enter, stop them and get their name. If they aren't on the list, don't let them in.
Stop
letting people in at 1AM."
<br>
You walk away feeling confident. The instructions are pretty clear. This guy outta be good for the night.
But let's explore a bit. A hipster with a man-bun approach the bouncer. His jeans are at least 2 sizes too small. He
makes a pained
expression. It could be the jeans or the idea of going into a non farm-to-table club.
<!--<figure>
    <img src="Manbun.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Don't mind me. Just thinking about Darfur. And Tibet.</figcaption>
</figure>
-->
<br>
The bouncer stops him.

<figure>
    <img src="Manbun.jpg" alt="" height="300" width="auto">
    <img src="bouncer.jpg" alt="" height="300" width="auto">
</figure>
<pre>
    Bouncer: One sec Chief. Can't let you in unless you're on the list. Name?
    ManBun: (Long sigh) John Smith.
    B: Sorry, not on the list.
    MB: I meant John Travolta.
    B: Ok, enjoy your night.
</pre>

<h4>What went wrong?</h4>
You never said to verify the person's identity.
<br>
A real person would probably know what Travolta looks like. If not they would at least need to be shown a fake ID that
had
the persons picture and Travolta's name. However a computer
without appropriate instructions would not.
<figure>
    <img src="MclovinID.jpg" alt="">
</figure>
Similarly, if someone stepped in and out of line giving multiple different names a real bouncer would remember their
previous interaction and
be suspicious. Again a computer without some instruction to remember past faces and names presented would not. This may
seem silly
but arises in real world situations with serious consequences. Improperly secured machines do not prevent unlimited
password attempts.
An attacker tries millions of passwords an hour until they find the right one. "A","B","C","D", "AD", etc.
<br>
If we loosened the language that could be used for programming languages it would require the computer to try to
discover our intent. The only
thing worse than computers blindly doing what we tell them would be them trying to decide what
our instructions should mean. (Do you want to get a Robot Uprising? Because that's how you get a Robot Uprising)

<br>
This would be disastrous and potentially very dangerous. So we have a semi-English language
which has very specific rules so a computer can always know how to execute what you want. So the benefit of the
abstraction of
higher level languages is something approaching English in terms of readability.
<br>
The "leaking" aspect are all the rules that restrict us. Its very apparent we are writing instructions for a computer.
This has a big
impact on the way a human can write and order instructions. It takes time to become comfortable.

<br>
All programming languages are attempting to maximize a tradeoff between being readable and expressive to humans AND
being
able to be implemented and optimized by the computer.

<br>

<h1>So we've sprung a leak. Where to from here?</h1>

Here's the good news, you don't have to know everything to perform meaningful work (and get paid!). Actually, let me
clarify. You
don't have to know every detail all the time.
<br>
So why would I encourage you to get a sense what's under the hood? Afterall, <span class="bold"> very few teachers will tell you is that unless you are working with something
daily, you will forget the details rapidly! </span> This is absolutely true. However, you will remember the broad
strokes.

<h1>Turning Black Boxes Gray</h1>

A black box is a component that performs an operation for you, but you have no idea how it does it. You are in the dark
(hence
the term black). Something that is a black box will work... until one day it doesn't. And then you have to learn about
it to repair it,
replace it, or bring someone in. So shine some light on it in advance.

<br>
The major differentiator between the best people in this field and the rest are what happens when things go off the
rails. Something inexplicably doesn't perform how you'd expect. What happens then? The best
people are able to triage. When things at the surface break, they can dive in, because they know something about
everything. More research might be required and they might have to learn more, or re-learn, but they have a basis point.
Its not brand new. This is extremely useful.
<br>

Additionally, the boxes that we use to watch cat videos on the internet are remarkable! They represent an accumulation
of enormous progress and learning about the underpinnings is both inspiring and illuminating. We've come to expect it
and
only notice when the video buffers, or drops to a lower quality setting. In short we notice when things fails, but
largely
dismiss it when it performs the miracles that even 20 years ago would have been unimaginable. A greater appreciation of
everything that occurs is valuable in its own right.


Building a house. Electrician as expert. "The electrician will handle it". Then he comes and asks you if he should use
20 or 40 Amp breakers in the garage. Uh... how much is 20 Amps? How much more do 40 Amp breakers cost?
I don't know you're the electrician. Well, I need to know what you're doing in there. Washers or dryers? No. Ok, any
serious power tools? What's a serious power tool? I've got some saws... Is it a big table saw? IDK. How many HP?
Your problem domain is cutting things. You understand the saw as such. The electrician has another level he operates at.
He sees the saw as an electrical motor. He knows motors pull much higher currents when starting vs operating. This
means you could trip the breakers, killing power to the garage. In this example the electrician is someone you can ask
for explanations and he can walk you along. When programming you can't ask the computer. You have to look up
documentation and understand the abstractions problem domain and how they solved it.

<br>

<br>
Example: For the average person, their TV is a black box. It plays video when they turn it on. How's it do it? They
probably have a hand wavey sense of signals over the air or thru the cable.
This is fine, most of the time. Then the TV fails out of warranty. Suddenly a more nuanced understanding is the
difference between an expensive repair bill or throwing it out and buying a new
TV. MANY TVs fail as a result of a bad capacitor. When they fail they tend to be obviously defective, normally bulging.
A capacitor can act as a filter or a battery. They have electrolytes (the same family
of substances tht are in Gatorade) that dry out as they age. A new capacitor might cost $4. So why does the repairman
charge you several hundred? He has knowledge you do not. This knowledge
enables him to fix something of value to you. He can therefor charge something between his costs and the cost of a
replacement TV.
