You don't have clutter, just interests that have fallen by the wayside.
Almost every activity involves acquiring some physical equipment. Learning a language? You probably have books, e-books, 
CDs, or MP3. Woodworking? Saws, hammers, sanding blocks, finishes, etc. When you see equipment you haven't touched in months, and 
haven't produced anything with, they weigh on you. Its a waste and you know its a waste. 

Someone else, sufficiently motivated, with the same equipment could be doing meaningful things. To sell it or give it away seems an 
admission that you will never do this, never take this further. I had plans, but I can't deliver. And the longer it sits the more it 
emotionally weighs to know that you aren't the type of person that makes progress. For me this is very damaging. I suspect it is for most people.
