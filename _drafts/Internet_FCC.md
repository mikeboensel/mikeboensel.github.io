A bilateral private peering agreement typically involves a direct physical link 
between two partners. Traffic from one network to the other is then primarily routed through that direct link. A Tier 1 network may have various such links to other Tier 
1 networks. Peering is founded on the principle of equality of traffic between 
the partners and as such disagreements may arise between partners in which 
usually one of the partners unilaterally disconnects the link in order to 
force the other into a payment scheme. Such disruptive de-peering has happened 
several times during the first decade of the 21st century. When this involves 
large-scale networks involving many millions of customers this may effectively 
partition a part of the Internet involving those carriers, especially if they 
decide to disallow routing through alternate routes. Essentially then, this is 
not largely a technical issue but a commercial matter in which a financial 
dispute is fought out using the other party's customers as hostages to obtain 
a better negotiating position. In the worst case, single-homed customers of 
each network will not be able to reach the other network at all. The 
de-peering party then hopes that the other network's customers will be 
hurt more by the decision than its own customers which may eventually 
conclude the negotiations in its favor
