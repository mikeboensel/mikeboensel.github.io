As I get older I've calmed down quite a bit. Most of the things that really annoyed me 10 years ago don't anymore, but there's one thing that 
still makes me want to scream. I've run into it twice recently and spent some time reflecting. 

# A little learning is a dangerous thing

I started going back through my old <a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-Course-Probability-8th/dp/013603313X/">Probability and Statistics textbook</a>. 
It was the only class I've ever had to retake. I got a D, then mercifully a C. Going back through I still can't follow some 
of the formula manipulations. Its obvious there's a lot of good stuff in there, its just not accessible. That's frustrating now. At the time it was 
infuriating. Yesterday, the top half of this page took me 20 minutes to work through.

	clear to someone out there. I don't think I've met them yet. It took me all the <span style="color:red">red boxed area</span> to verify this is true. 
	I would have used more space if it was available. </figcaption>

My math is better now. As is my patience. In school I couldn't understand the steps and intuition behind how equations were arrived at. So I was left with rote 
memorization. Clearly, it did not go well. I couldn't get over how unbelievably poor a book it was for its stated purpose: a FIRST COURSE.


I'm also taking a cryptography course on Coursera. I'm in the final week and really like it. It's a bit of a whirlwind, but the material is very 
interesting and the professor is clearly passionate. I've been following along taking the quizzes. I've passed them 
all, but frequently find myself mad on taking them. Inevitably I think "What the hell is this? I have no idea how to approach this. 
Did I miss a lecture?". 

A typical quiz is:
+ 30% - clear application of what we learned.
+ 40% - slightly confusing, requiring review of lectures, my notes, and some thought.
+ 30% - complete left field. (I don't want to think about the time I spent on these) 

That final 30% took concepts we'd scratched the surface of and expanded out from. 
When I'd look at the lectures the details were sparse. The professor said once, "I don't want to get into the details, but for our purposes 
just know <fill in the blank>". And now problems related to it are showing up ... Yeah, you didn't want to deal with it and neither do I....

# So, why was I mad? 

Clearly its not a productive emotion for learning...but...

## I felt a social contract had been violated
In my mind that contract read: 
<blockquote style="margin-left:10%">
"You teach, highlighting important points and structuring things. I take notes. I review sections until they make sense. 
Occassionally I hop over to some external resource to get some further detail or specifics. Then the assignments act as a
check on whether I've put forward a fair effort and absorbed the material we covered. Having learned 
what we're doing this week I should look at the homework and feel comfortable."
</blockquote>


The nightmare is encountering this:

## My life suddenly feels out of my control. 

Dramatic much? I know, but bear with me. The degree of distress depends on the level of investment. 

Imagine a crucial, major related, course offered once a year. That's devestating. It can threaten your planned course scheduling, potentially meaning 
another year in school, $20-$30k in costs, a resume showing a 4 year degree taking 5, etc. I might as well be on a sub launching nukes, red lights 
are bouncing off metalic structures and alarms blaring.

	The feeling is basically indistinguishable right now.</figcaption>
</figure>

Meanwhile, this Coursera course? That's lower stakes, just the time I've put in on the previous tests. I can always drop back to auditing the course. 

### A disconnect of effort and outcome
There's a sense that the investment I've put into learning may have no ultimate bearing on my success. I could have reviewed everything, but if I 
can't discover this new relationship between X and Y that wasn't really touched on by the professor I'm screwed. 

Its certainly reasonable to argue tough, novel problems are a differentiatior. Who should get an A, B, or C? Sure I can buy that. The 
issue comes when we cross a threshold. I definitively know I'm not failing the class if I can walk away from a test knowing that I got 90% right. 
That's a healthy threshold. 80%? Not terrible. 70%... now what if I made a silly error?
I've got no margin for that. 

As the uncertainty mounts my grade becomes more dependent on the professor's judgement than me. There's a lot suddenly riding on the kindness of 
a stranger I met a few months ago to give me a fair shake with partial credit, curving, etc.

It's unnerving. Moreover it seems like you're being given something, rather than earning it. 

# Students are from Saturn, Professors from Pluto

The source of the disconnect is not malicious. We have 2 very different populations interacting in a course: graduate students (and former grad students) who are acting as 
professors, TAs, etc. and the students (largely undergrads, who will not go on to postgrad studies). Those groups have different success models. 

As a guy just learning this, if I can apply and understand the basic principles in the real world, that's a fantastic outcome. I'll shake your hand 
and thank you for a great course.

I suspect for the professor and TAs basic application is boring and unrewarding. Their career success relies on branching out into new directions with their 
research. An understanding of the work of others and the state of the art is just a necessary step along the way. I don't think that step is rewarded, but 
instead considered pro forma. Further, this is all old stuff for them. It seems slow and trudging.

The most human thing in the world is to extrapolate based on our own experiences. If I'm finding this dull isn't it natural the students would as well? 
Let's move onto a novel problem! How could these students not be bored with these basics? Why not provide further opportunity for expansion 
and discovery? Give them a taste of those magical "Aha!" moments that can lead to publishing, grants, etc.

It's a noble goal, but needs to be tempered by 2 things.
1. There's a fixed amount of time and effort I can invest in your class. In college I had 3 other classes. 
Now I've got real world demands on my time, so I've cut out a chunk of time (~10 hours a week seemed like a fair investment). I want to get 
a mastery of basics. I'm looking for a curated experience of the subject. Sound priviledged? Perhaps. But that's what college is. An interested student 
could certainly buy the books and read the research articles themselves. But the hope is to get a guide through foreign territory. 

2. As we get further from what was taught there's the danger exemplified in this cartoon.
