As I get older I've calmed down quite a bit. Most of the things that really annoyed me 10 years ago don't anymore, but there's one thing that 
still infuriates me. I've run into it twice recently and spent some time 
thinking about it. I've started going back through my old Introduction to Probability textbook (Ross). It was the text for the only class I've ever had to
retake. I got a D, then mercifully a C. No joke, the first 10 pages took me an hour (its full of proofs and is extremely dense). I can't not follow some 
of the formula manipulations. Its obvious even to a dummy like me there's a lot of good stuff in there. It's frustrating but manageable now, but at the time I couldn't 
get over how unbelievably poor a book it was for an INTRODUCTION.

Additionally, I'm taking a cryptography course on Coursera. I'm in the final week and really like it. It's a bit of a whirlwind, but the material is very interesting and the professor is clearly 
passionate. Coursera offers the ability to audit the course (just watch the lectures) or additionally perform the assignments to earn an optional certificate 
(if you pay). The assignments are mandatory quizzes and optional programming assignments.I decided I'd at least do the quizzes. I've passed them 
all, but frequently find myself mad on taking them. Inevitably I think "What the hell is this? I have no idea how to approach this. 
Did I miss a lecture?". 

The typical quiz is:
+ 30% - clear application of what we learned (~5 minutes each)
+ 40% - slightly confusing, requires review of lectures and notes. I would have some reasonable answer. 
It might not have been right, but it feels doable and I can get going down the right track. (~20 minutes each)
+ 30% - a seemingly malicious attempt to weed people out. (I don't want to think about the time I spent on these) 

For reference a passing grade is 80%. So that final 30% is crucial. It was material that took concepts we'd scratched the surface of and expanded out from. 
When I looked at the lectures the details are sparse. Sometimes the professor would literally say, "I don't want to get into the details, but for our purposes 
just know <fill in the blank>". And now showing why this is true is a problem on the homework... Yeah, you didn't want to deal with it and neither do I....

So, why was I mad?
1. I felt there was a violation of a social contract.
In my mind that contract read: "You teach, highlighting important points and structuring things. I take notes. I review sections until they make sense. 
Occassionally I hop over to some external resource (Wikipedia, library books, etc) to get some further detail or specifics. Then the assignments act as a
check on whether I've put forward a fair effort and absorbed the material we covered. Having learned 
what we're doing this week I should look at the homework and feel comfortable."

2. My life feels out of my control. Dramatic much? I know, but bear with me. The degree of distress depends on the level of investment. I'm on a sub launching nukes,
red lights bouncing off metalic structures and alarms blaring if
that class is a pre-requisite offered once a year. That's directly threatening my course scheduling, meaning another year in school, $20-$30k in costs, 
employers looking at my 5 year stay, etc. Was this professor put here to ruin me? Meanwhile, this Coursera course? That's lower stakes, just the time I've put in on the previous tests. 
I can always drop back to auditing the course. But it still taps into all those feelings. 

There's a sense that the investment I've put into learning may 
have no ultimate bearing on my success. I could have reviewed everything, but if I can't discover this new relationship between X and Y that wasn't really touched on by the professor I'm 
screwed. You might say, but the problems are a differentiatior. The professor has to have some way to decide who should get 
an A, B, C, etc. Sure I can buy that, but the more differentiation there is the more my grade becomes dependent on the professor than me. I'm not failing if 
I can walk away from a test knowing that I got 80% right. If its closer to 60% I'm sure about, then there's a lot riding on partial credit, curving, luck, etc. 

# The source of the disconnect

But here's what it comes down to. You have 2 very different populations interacting in a course: graduate students (and former grad students) who are teaching 
and the undergrads who make up the majority of the students (and largely will not go on to postgrad studies). We have different success models. For 
me as a guy just learning this, if I can apply the basic principles in the real world, that's a fantastic outcome. 

I suspect that for grad students that's boring and unrewarding. You make headway by branching out into new directions, understanding the work of others and the 
state of the art is just a necessary step along the way. So what you find rewarding is entirely different than what I do. Further, your knowledge is a superset 
of what you're teaching. So this all seems slow and trudging. These students must be bored with these basics! Why not provide further opportunity for expansion 
and discovery? Give them a taste of those magical "Aha!" moments that can lead to publishing, grants, etc.

You're not wrong. But I have a fixed amount of time and effort I can invest in your class. I had it at the time in college (I've got 
3 other classes) and I've got it now (~10 hours a week seems like a fair investment for a non-student). I want to get a mastery of basics. I'm looking for a 
curated experience of the subject. Sound priviledged? Perhaps. But that's what college is. You could certainly buy the books and read the research 
articles yourself. But you're hoping to get a guide through foreign territory. 


# "I don't want to teach to the test" 
I hear that phrase frequently with negative connotations from educators. Well thats exactly what I want you do to. The test 
should reflect what I'm supposed to learn. If it doesn't change the test. Its supposed to function as the bar. Okay student, now go clear it. Its you're job 
to help me clear it. Not to set it a foot lower in practice then jack it up when its for all the marbles.
