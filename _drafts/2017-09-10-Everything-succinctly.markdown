Hi there. I'm Mike. I'm very excited to begin this series and I'm going to start with 2 absurd statements:

1. Your computer is magic. For that matter so is your tv, phone, coffee machine, etc.

   Whether you begrudgingly use a cellphone to look at pictures of your grandchildren or you program professionally at some point you just wave your hands 
   in the air because you've hit the limits. "I dunno how it works. It just does." Beyond this point, the world falls away into uncharted waters. Here be dragons.

   There's nothing wrong with that, its a beautiful thing! Its like new continents are constantly springing up, full of mysteries to explore. The world 
   is progressing so rapidly in so many directions. Netflix spends millions to generate movie recommendations based on our previous history, that we watch on smart phones 
   that have only been around 10 years. Now we're charging head first into Artificial and Augmented Reality and I'm barely breaking the surface. The speed of innovation is 
   remarkable.


2. Everyone who is willing to invest a minimal amount of time can grasp the concepts. EVERYONE. Without exception. From that conceptual stepping stone 
   you can go as far as you'd like. It will still be work, but it will be easier. Things become intuitive.

   Bullshit, you might say. Hear me out. 

   # Calculus ... tangent :)

   Calculus is a scary subject for many people, including engineers. I can remember being overjoyed after passing the 4 I had to take. It was miserable. <b>I was embarassed at how bad 
   I was.</b> 

   I've subsequently gone back for personal enjoyment and read some books. I wanted to be better and there was nothing at risk, save my ego and time.

    <figcaption style="text-align: center">A great (and short-ish) book</figcaption>
</figure>

  I'm now confident I could teach calculus to a 12 year old. [Here's my attempt. You be the judge.]({{site.url}} "/jekyll/update/2017/09/10/Gentle-introduction-to-calculus.html" )

# My goal

I'm trying to address a few problems I see in the way people learn about computing:
1. Education tends to be highly focused. As a result people's knowledge is very specific. They know a ton about compilers or Excel or the Operating System, etc., but precious 
  little beyond that. And it makes sense. Since the Industrial Revolution increased specialization has been the norm. 

  > Job specialization is advantageous in developing employee expertise in a field and boosting organizational production. 
  > However, disadvantages of job specialization included limited employee skill, a dependence on entire department fluency, and employee discontent with repetitious tasks.

  To put it simpler, you are pidgeonholed and need to be part of a large supporting staff to create a final product that people will actually pay for. This ties you to the company or 
  a company like it, limiting your options. 

  Everyone is trying to farm out work to other experts and in theory it works very well. However, in practice <b> how do you pick an expert if you know almost nothing about the field?</b> 
  You don't even have a BS detector and anyone claiming to be an experts isn't coming cheap. 

  Mastery of a subject can take years, but basic comprehension occurs in a fraction the time and confers a ton of value. Knowing a little bit about a lot is powerful. I'm not a mechanic,
  I'm going to hire someone to do anything beyond light maintenance (oil changes, air filter, etc). But I better make sure I know some basics or I'm going to be taken for a ride.

	<figcaption style="text-align: center">No one's going to mistake me for Dale Earnhardt, but I can pick out most of the items here and know their general operation.
	That's helpful when talking to a mechanic about repairs.</figcaption>
</figure>

  You cannot be blissfully ignorant.

2. Teaching is inherently difficult and somewhat unrewarding. In my experience most professors and grad students are more interested in research work than helping undergraduates 
  sort things out. That doesn't make them bad people. Economics could be summarized as "People react to incentives". The incentives in academia skew strongly toward research and 
  publishing papers. 

  A perfect teacher would be able to figure out exactly where the audience is and tune the class goals so its operating right on the edge of their understanding. 
  New concepts are being introduced, but not so many that people become lost and discouraged. That's a hell of a task. For someone like me, with limited knowledge of who will read
  this, it's impossible. So I'm going to cheat.

  Everything builds upon itself and gaps in knowledge are treacherous. They're like missing pieces low on a Jenga tower. You can only stack so much up before they catch up with you.
  So rather than assuming you have some prerequisite knowledge we are going to build up, from a level anyone with basic math and reading skills should be able to comprehend. Eventually
  we will be discussing programming, AIs, Operating Systems, etc. 

# Why am I doing this?
Over the years I've had priviledge of reading from [Michael Nielsen]("http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/"), [Mike Bostock]("https://bost.ocks.org/mike/"), [Salman Khan]("https://www.khanacademy.org/"), 
and many others. I've learned about 
neural networks, data visualization, etc. Topics that I struggled with when reading other authors or had no idea about. They present difficult topics in simple terms, step by step,
building from a basic foundation to practical application. I have a tremendous admiration for this style. 
There's no doubt in my mind that their time could be better spent (economically). They're essentially doing charity work. I feel indebted to them and would like to contribute (hopefully) to
this broader community. 


# Calling you out
So here's my challenge for you. Give me a shot. Leave feedback. If something I write doesn't make sense, let me know. I'll work on it.
Collaboratively we'll build a series that can take someone with no background in computing and allow them to have a conversation with professionals or help professionals branch
out into new areas within the field.

So I guess I'm saying... Come along with me on a fantastic voyage :)
