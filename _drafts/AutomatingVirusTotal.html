    <title>Virus scanning overview</title>
</head>
<body>
Every day, sometimes multiple times, I download something (programs, PDFs, Github projects) and pop over to
<a href="www.virustotal.com">VirusTotal</a> to scan it. VirusTotal let's you upload files and have it scanned by
60+ AntiVirus (AV) products. It's not a fool proof solution, but it's a big step up from just using Microsoft Security
Essentials (the Windows default).
<br>
As Brian Krebs <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/05/antivirus-is-dead-long-live-antivirus/">has pointed out</a>
malware authors now leverage "crypting" services. These sites sell a service where they take a customer's malware and
run it against a large number of AVs. If its detected they modify it and rescan. They repeat this process until
the malware is FUD (Fully UnDetectable). It will remain FUD from this point in time, until those AVs make changes to
their detection.
So the threats are significantly more stealthy. They've stepped up their game, using many scanners is my attempt to
mitigate that.
<br>
Just a quick aside, AVs scan using a "signature" based approach. Based on past malware they've seen they create a set of
heuristics (rules of thumb)
that let them make a decision about any software they encounter.
<br>
An example: Maybe a particular virus always creates a temporary
file called asdf.txt for instance. Most other programs won't be creating a file with that name (its just the 4 keys your
left hand
is on if you use the touch typing home key approach I think they still teach in school).
This would become part of the AVs rules for determining if a file is bad. This is a blacklisting approach. You create a
list of things that are suspicious,
if you see enough of them in the file in question its flagged as bad.
<br>
Blacklisting has a number of problems:
<ol>
    <li>It creates false positives.
        <p>Imagine a legit program for the Alaska State Defense Force (ASDF) creates a file asdf.txt. That MAY be
            flagged
            as a virus because it is similar to a characteristic of a known virus. It all depends on how heavily that
            signature
            is weighted and what else the program contains.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Blacklisting only tells you that MAYBE this file is safe
        <p>You can write a harmful program that doesn't have any (or enough) of the signatures in it to be considered a
            virus. Or you can take a file that would be detected and pack it (encrypt the contents and have the program
            unpack itself
            on running)</p></li>
    <li>It "doesn't scale"
        <p>People will tell you this, but neither blacklisting or whitelisting (our next topic) do. They both have
            limitations,
            so its a matter of what you prioritize in your approach</p></li>
</ol>

<br>
The other possible approach is whitelisting. AV companies would determine software that is definitely safe. Everything
else is flagged as potentially dangerous. It may or may not be, the AV company hasn't had a chance to look at it yet.
The issue with this is:
<ol>
    <li>Its very slow. The AV companies become a bottleneck to all software products.
        <p>Everytime a programmer pushes a patch, releases a new application, or makes any change that has to be
            installed, first it has to be reviewed by the List maintainer. Millions of pieces of software are written
            each day. Its complex and can be difficult for the people who wrote (and know the code base) to make sense
            of.
            Imagine how much more difficult it would be for the AV company.
            <br>
            The speed of reviews could be sped up if you the AV companies received the source code and compilation
            instructions (use GCC version x on Ubuntu 14.02, etc. A virtual machine image would probably be the most appropriate way
            to send a build environment) to generate the final artifact. Analyzing a binary is certainly doable, but its not
            friendly. Other techniques like putting the program in a virtual machine and observing the changes it makes to the environment
            are also from the outside looking in. A lot of malware has means of determining whether its running in a virtual environment,
            being debugged, etc. Having the source and being able to generate the exact same artifact that the developer intends to
            distribute makes life much easier. But it implies a HUGE amount of trust (see next point).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>It puts all the trust in the AV company to act properly.
        <p>Imagine releasing a new photo app. There's a lot of competition. You want to get to market
            as soon as possible. What if some of the AV companies were owned by a conglomerates, with their own photo
            app divisions?
            Would they "lose" your app in the pile to give themselves a head start? Users would scan your app and have
            it come
            back as not on the whitelist and possibly move onto the competitor
            <br>
            You might say this is a concern with blacklisting as well and that is true. However, it is mitigated by the
            fact that
            they have to create signatures to flag a competitor's file, but they don't know in advance what that file
            will look like,
            which makes it harder to prevent an initial push into the market.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>

<br>So bottom line is the approach you take is a tradeoff. Most solutions rely on blacklisting, allowing them to return
a verdict for any file with a lesser assurance of it actually being correct. Sometimes it fails spectacularly. Recently,
Google's app store discovered apps that had a combined million+ downloads that
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/09/malicious-apps-with-1-million-downloads-slip-past-google-defenses-twice/">
    were stealing from users.</a>

<br>So with that big caveat, its still better than nothing. Combined with being smart online (only downloading from
trustworthy sources, checking hashes, looking for valid signatures, etc) its generally enough.
